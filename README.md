# To-Do List App

A simple and elegant **To-Do List** web application that allows users to add, check off, and remove tasks. The app also saves the user's list in their browser's local storage, so the tasks persist even after a page reload.

## Features

- Add new tasks by clicking the **ADD** button or pressing the **Enter** key.
- Mark tasks as complete by clicking on them.
- Remove tasks by clicking the **×** button next to each task.
- Saves tasks in **local storage** so that the list persists between browser sessions.
